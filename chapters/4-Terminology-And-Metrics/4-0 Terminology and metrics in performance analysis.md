# Terminology and Metrics in Performance Analysis {#sec:secMetrics}

Like many engineering disciplines, Performance Analysis is quite heavy on using peculiar terms and metrics. For a beginner, it can be a very hard time looking into a profile generated by an analysis tool like Linux `perf` and Intel VTune Profiler. Those tools juggle with many complex terms and metrics, however, it is a "must-know" if you're set to do any serious performance engineering work. 

This chapter is a gentle introduction to the basic terminology and metrics used in performance analysis. We will first define the basic things like retired/executed instructions, IPC/CPI, UOPs, core/reference clocks, cache misses and branch mispredictions. Then we will see how to measure the memory latency and bandwidth of a system and introduce some more advanced metrics. In the end, we will benchmark four industry workloads and look at the collected metrics.
