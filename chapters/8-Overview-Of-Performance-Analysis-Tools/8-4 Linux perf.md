## Linux Perf

We will use Linux `perf` extensively throughout the book as it is one of the most popular performance analysis tools. This tool is available on most Linux distributions, which makes it accessible for a wide range of users. Another reason why the author prefers showcasing Linux `perf` is that it is open-sourced, which allows us to see the mechanics of what is going on in a typical profiling tool. This is especially useful for learning concepts presented in this book because GUI-based tools, like Intel® VTune™ Profiler, tend to hide all the complexity. More information about Linux `perf` is available on its [wiki page](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)[^1].

[TODO]: skip examples as there are plenty of them later in the book.

[TODO]: there are many tools that can postprocess and visualize the output of Linux perf. For example, KDAB hotspots, Netflix flamescope, flamegraphs, etc.
