1. Solve the following lab assignments using techniques we discussed in this chapter:
- `perf-ninja::lookup_tables_1`
- `perf-ninja::virtual_call_mispredict`
- `perf-ninja::conditional_store_1`
2. Collect TMA breakdown for the application you're working on or some randomly picked benchmark. Check the BadSpeculation metric. Look at the code that was attributed with the most number of branch mispredictions. Is there a way to use techniques we discussed in this chapter?
