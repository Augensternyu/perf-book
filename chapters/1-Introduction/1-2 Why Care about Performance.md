## Why Care about Performance?

In addition to the slowing trend of hardware single-threaded performance growth, there are a couple of other business reasons to care about performance. During the PC era,[^3] the costs of slow software were paid by the users, as inefficient software was running on user computers. With the advent of SaaS (software as a service) and cloud computing, the costs of slow software are put back on the software providers, not their users. If you're a SaaS company like Meta or Netflix,[^4] it doesn't matter if you run your service on-premise hardware or you use public cloud, you pay for the electricity your servers consume. Inefficient software cuts right into your margins and market evaluation. According to Synergy Research Group,[^5] worldwide spending on cloud services topped $100 billion in 2020, and according to Gartner,[^6] it will surpass $675 billion in 2024.

For many years performance engineering was a nerdy niche, but now it's becoming mainstream. Many companies have already realized the importance of performance engineering and are willing to pay well for this work.

It is fairly easy to reach performance level 4 in Table @tbl:PlentyOfRoom. In fact, you don't need this book to get there. Write your program in one of the native programming languages, distribute work among multiple threads, pick a good optimizing compiler and you'll get there. Unfortunately, this will only put you halfway to the desired efficiency target.

The methodologies in this book focus on squeezing out the last bit of performance from your application. Such transformations can be attributed along rows 6 and 7 in Table @tbl:PlentyOfRoom. The types of improvements that will be discussed are usually not big and often do not exceed 10%. However, do not underestimate the importance of a 10% speedup. SQLite is commonplace today not because its developers sat one day and decided to make it 50% faster. But because they meticulously made hundreds of 0.1% improvements over the years. The cumulative effect of these small improvements is what makes the difference.

The impact of small improvements is very relevant for large distributed applications running in the cloud. According to [@HennessyGoogleIO], in the year 2018, Google spent roughly the same amount of money on actual computing servers that run the cloud as it spent on power and cooling infrastructure. Energy efficiency is a very important problem, which can be improved by optimizing software.

In addition to cloud costs, there is the another factor at play: how people percieve slow software. For instance, Google reported that a 2% slower search caused [2% fewer searches](https://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/29/Keynote Presentation 2.pdf) per user.[^7] For Yahoo! 400 milliseconds faster page load caused [5-9% more traffic](https://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/dont-make-me-wait-or-building-highperformance-web-applications).[^8] In the game of big numbers, small improvements can make a significant impact. Such examples prove that the slower the service works, the fewer people will use it. 

Outside cloud services, there are many other performance-critical industries where performance engineering does not need to be justified, such as, High-Performance Computing (HPC), High-Frequency Trading (HFT), Game Development, etc. Moreover, performance is not only required in highly specialized areas, it is also relevant for general-purpose applications and services. Many tools that we use every day simply would not exist if they failed to meet their performance requirements. For example, Visual C++ [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-cpp-intellisense)[^2] features that are integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio IDE have very tight performance constraints. For IntelliSense autocomplete feature to work, they have to parse the entire source codebase in the order of milliseconds.[^9] Nobody will use source code editor if it takes it several seconds to suggest autocomplete options. Such a feature has to be very responsive and provide valid continuations as the user types new code.

> "Not all fast software is world-class, but all world-class software is fast. Performance is _the_ killer feature." - Tobi Lutke, CEO of Shopify.

I hope it goes without saying that people hate using slow software. Performance characteristics of an application can be a single factor for your customer to switch to a competitor's product. By putting emphasis on performance, you can give your product a competitive advantage.

Sometimes fast tools find use in the areas they were not initially designed for. For example, nowadays, game engines like Unreal and Unity are used in architecture, 3d visualization, film making, and other areas. Because game engines are so performant, they are a natural choice for applications that require 2d and 3d rendering, physics engine, collision detection, sound, animation, etc.

Before starting performance-related work, make sure you have a strong reason to do so. Optimization just for optimization’s sake is useless if it doesn’t add value to your product. Mindful performance engineering starts with clearly defined performance goals, stating what you are trying to achieve and why you are doing it. Also, you should pick the metrics that you will use to measure whether you reach the goal or not.

Now that we've talked about the value of performance engineering, let's uncover what it consist of. When you trying to improve performance of a program, you need to find what to improve (performance analysis) and then improve it (tuning), which is very similar to a regular debugging activity. This is what we will discuss next.
